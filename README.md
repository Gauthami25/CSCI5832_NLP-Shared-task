Task 6: LegalEval: Understanding Legal Texts

Legal NER


Problem:

Named Entities Recognition is a frequently researched issue in Natural Language Processing, and there are numerous publicly available pre-trained models. However, when it comes to domain specific entities, in this the legal domain, entities like names of petitioner, respondent, court, statute, provision, precedents, etc. are hard to detect using the regular, off the shelf named entity recognizers. Moreover, standard Named Entity Recognizers like spacy do not recognize these entity types. Therefore, it is necessary to create a Legal NER model fine-tuned on legal documents and entities. Up until now, there werenâ€™t any publicly accessible annotated datasets. But now that we have it, it is crucial to create a separate legal NER for texts of Indian court judgments and the fact that these documents are filled with peculiarities of Indian legal processes and terminology makes it a challenging problem to solve.
